If both a and b are 0, gcd is zero gcd(0, 0) = 0.
gcd(a, 0) = a and gcd(0, b) = b because everything divides 0.
If a and b are both even, gcd(a, b) = 2*gcd(a/2, b/2) because 2 is a common divisor. Multiplication with 2 can be done with bitwise 
shift operator.
If a is even and b is odd, gcd(a, b) = gcd(a/2, b). Similarly, if a is odd and b is even, then
gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b/2). It is because 2 is not a common divisor.
If both a and b are odd, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(|a-b|/2, b). Note that difference of two odd numbers is even
Repeat steps 3â€“5 until a = b, or until a = 0. In either case, the GCD is power(2, k) * b, where power(2, k) is 2 raise to the power of k
and k is the number of common factors of 2 found in step 2.
